# Fake News Detection Using LLM 

This project builds on Phase 1 (ML-based Fake News Detection) by fine-tuning a **DistilBERT transformer model** to detect fake news articles using the **ISOT Fake News Dataset**.

>  *This is an educational project — model predictions reflect linguistic patterns, not factual verification.*

##  What This Project Does

- Loads and prepares ISOT dataset (Real/Fake news)
- Fine-tunes DistilBERT using Hugging Face `Trainer`
- Saves the model and uses it for **inference**
- Provides a **Flask app** to try out predictions
- Includes **unit tests** and modular Python code

---

##  Dataset Citation

This project uses the **ISOT Fake News Dataset**, created by the [ISOT Lab, University of Victoria](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/isot/2022/11/27/fake-news-detection-datasets/).

- **Source**: [ISOT Dataset Page](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/isot/2022/11/27/fake-news-detection-datasets/)
---

## Model Training & Evaluation

- Tokenizer: `DistilBertTokenizerFast`
- Model: `DistilBertForSequenceClassification`
- Framework: `transformers`, `datasets`, `Trainer`
- Epochs: default = 5–10 (adjustable)
- Evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, F1
- Live tracking: `TensorBoard` (logs/)

Training is run via:
```bash
python training/run_llm_training.py
```
Or in Kaggle notebook (see linked notebook URL).

---

##  Flask Web App (app/)

Use the trained model in a Flask app to test predictions interactively.

Start it locally:
```bash
cd app
python app.py
```
Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

---

##  Unit Tests

Unit tests are in `training/tests/`:
```bash
pytest training/tests/
```
Covers:
- Data preparation
- Tokenisation
- Model structure and prediction

---

## Disclaimer

> This model was fine-tuned on historical news articles (ISOT 2017) and is not guaranteed to be accurate on modern news or factual verification. It reflects **linguistic patterns**, not factual truth.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key packages:
- `transformers`
- `datasets`

##  Future Work

- Improve model with more recent datasets
- Integrate a GPT-based zero-shot classifier
- Add feedback loop + explanation interface (e.g., LIME)
- Deploy with Hugging Face Spaces or Render
